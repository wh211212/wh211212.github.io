    <content type="text"><![CDATA[ovirt 上创建vm模板安装初始化虚拟机CentOS7 （笔者虚机暂时只有C7，C6），后面会加入更多的镜像及vm模板 如下如：以aniu-ecs-03为例： 当我们安装完成虚拟机后，ovirt管理控制台是不能正常获取到虚拟机的ip地址和主机名的，（Ovirt无法获取 IP Addresses 和 FQDN），因此我们需要安装ovirt-guest-agent-common软件包，然后启动ovirt-guest-agent服务，这个程序会获取vm的FQDN和ip上传到ovirt engine展示。 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647# C7添加ovirt源[root@localhost ~]# yum -y install http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release42.rpm# 安装ovirt agent tools[root@localhost ~]# yum install ovirt-guest-agent-common -y# 启动ovirt-guest-agent，并设置自启# 参考：https://www.ovirt.org/documentation/vmm-guide/chap-Installing_Linux_Virtual_Machines/[root@localhost ~]# systemctl start qemu-guest-agent.service[root@localhost ~]# systemctl enable qemu-guest-agent.service# 查看ovirt agent启动状态[root@localhost ~]# systemctl status qemu-guest-agent● qemu-guest-agent.service - QEMU Guest Agent Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/qemu-guest-agent.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: active (running) since Tue 2018-04-17 15:52:20 CST; 1min 18s ago Main PID: 7881 (qemu-ga) CGroup: /system.slice/qemu-guest-agent.service └─7881 /usr/bin/qemu-ga --method=virtio-serial --path=/dev/virtio-ports/org.qemu.guest_agent.0 --blacklist=guest-file-open,guest-file-close,guest-file-read,guest-file-write,guest-file...Apr 17 15:52:20 localhost.localdomain systemd[1]: Started QEMU Guest Agent.Apr 17 15:52:20 localhost.localdomain systemd[1]: Starting QEMU Guest Agent...[root@localhost ~]# systemctl status qemu-guest-agent# 启动ovirt-guest-agent # 笔者这里启动了两个服务ovirt-guest-agent和qemu-guest-agent[root@localhost ~]# systemctl start ovirt-guest-agent[root@localhost ~]# systemctl enable ovirt-guest-agentCreated symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/ovirt-guest-agent.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/ovirt-guest-agent.service.[root@localhost ~]# systemctl status ovirt-guest-agent● ovirt-guest-agent.service - oVirt Guest Agent Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ovirt-guest-agent.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled) Active: active (running) since Tue 2018-04-17 16:00:05 CST; 11s ago Main PID: 7945 (python) CGroup: /system.slice/ovirt-guest-agent.service └─7945 /usr/bin/python /usr/share/ovirt-guest-agent/ovirt-guest-agent.pyApr 17 16:00:05 localhost.localdomain systemd[1]: Starting oVirt Guest Agent...Apr 17 16:00:05 localhost.localdomain systemd[1]: Started oVirt Guest Agent.Apr 17 16:00:06 localhost.localdomain userhelper[7955]: pam_succeed_if(ovirt-container-list:auth): requirement &quot;user = ovirtagent&quot; was met by user &quot;ovirtagent&quot;Apr 17 16:00:06 localhost.localdomain userhelper[7954]: pam_succeed_if(ovirt-container-list:auth): requirement &quot;user = ovirtagent&quot; was met by user &quot;ovirtagent&quot;Apr 17 16:00:06 localhost.localdomain userhelper[7954]: running &apos;/usr/share/ovirt-guest-agent/container-list&apos; with root privileges on behalf of &apos;ovirtagent&apos;Apr 17 16:00:06 localhost.localdomain userhelper[7955]: running &apos;/usr/share/ovirt-guest-agent/container-list&apos; with root privileges on behalf of &apos;ovirtagent&apos;Apr 17 16:00:06 localhost.localdomain userhelper[7965]: pam_succeed_if(ovirt-locksession:auth): requirement &quot;user = ovirtagent&quot; was met by user &quot;ovirtagent&quot;Apr 17 16:00:06 localhost.localdomain userhelper[7965]: running &apos;/usr/share/ovirt-guest-agent/LockActiveSession.py&apos; with root privileges on behalf of &apos;ovirtagent&apos;Apr 17 16:00:15 localhost.localdomain userhelper[7987]: pam_succeed_if(ovirt-container-list:auth): requirement &quot;user = ovirtagent&quot; was met by user &quot;ovirtagent&quot;Apr 17 16:00:15 localhost.localdomain userhelper[7987]: running &apos;/usr/share/ovirt-guest-agent/container-list&apos; with root privileges on behalf of &apos;ovirtagent&apos; 等待一会到ovirt管理界面查看aniu-ecs-03是否能够正常显示ip和FQDN 从上图可以看出，从ovirt控制面板能够ovirt engine已经获取到了vm的ip地址但是 FQDN貌似还没有获取到，笔者准备进行对vm进行一些初始化设置 禁用IPV6及关闭selinux，笔者用不到 12345678910111213141516# 修改主机名编辑hosts[root@localhost ~]# hostnamectl set-hostname ecs-03[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/hosts127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain# 建议修改配置文件关闭，需要重启sed -i &apos;s/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/g&apos; /etc/selinux/config## 修改启动加载的内核参数[root@localhost ~]# vi /etc/default/grub# line 6: addGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=&quot;ipv6.disable=1 rd.lvm.lv=fedora-server/root.....# apply changing[root@localhost ~]# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg [root@localhost ~]# reboot 再次到控制台查看aniu-ecs-03的ip和FQDN情况，如下： 使用aniu-ecs-03创建vm模板 笔者的aniu-ecs-03规格为：Medium 2 cpu 4G mem 20G disk ，GMT China Standard Time，设置了HA， 停止aniu-ecs-03，然后右上角选择make template，如下： 自定义模板名称，描述，点击ok确认创建模板： 创建模板介绍先写到这里，笔者的想法是继续对vm完善，安装一些必须的依赖包，在进行创建模板。 创建模板后续 https://www.ovirt.org/documentation/how-to/virtual-machines/sealing-linux-vm/ ：参考设置更干净的vm模板]]></content>

| sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/elasticsearch.repo Elasticsearch 源创建完成之后，通过makecache查看源是否可用，然后通过yum安装Elasticsearch ： 12yum makecacheyum install elasticsearch -y 要将Elasticsearch配置为在系统引导时自动启动，请运行以下命令： 12sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reloadsudo /bin/systemctl enable elasticsearch.service Elasticsearch可以按如下方式启动和停止： 12sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.servicesudo systemctl stop elasticsearch.service 这些命令不会提供有关Elasticsearch是否已成功启动的反馈。相反，此信息将写入位于/ var / log / elasticsearch /中的日志文件中。 默认情况下，Elasticsearch服务不会记录systemd日志中的信息。要启用journalctl日志记录，必须从elasticsearch中的ExecStart命令行中删除–quiet选项。服务文件。 12# 注释24行的 --quiet \vim /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/elasticsearch.service 当启用systemd日志记录时，使用journalctl命令可以获得日志记录信息： 使用tail查看journal： 1sudo journalctl -f 要列出elasticsearch服务的日记帐分录： 1sudo journalctl --unit elasticsearch 要从给定时间开始列出elasticsearch服务的日记帐分录： 123sudo journalctl --unit elasticsearch --since &quot;2017-1-4 10:17:16&quot;# since 表示指定时间之前的记录 使用man journalctl 查看journalctl 更多使用方法 检查Elasticsearch是否正在运行 您可以通过向localhost上的端口9200发送HTTP请求来测试Elasticsearch节点是否正在运行： 1curl -XGET &apos;localhost:9200/?pretty&apos; 我们能得到下面这样的回显： 12345678910111213&#123; &quot;name&quot; : &quot;De-LRNO&quot;, &quot;cluster_name&quot; : &quot;elasticsearch&quot;, &quot;cluster_uuid&quot; : &quot;DeJzplWhQQK5uGitXr8jjA&quot;, &quot;version&quot;

: &quot;6.3.0&quot; &#125;, &quot;tagline&quot; : &quot;You Know, for Search&quot;&#125; 配置 Elasticsearch Elasticsearch 从默认的/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml加载配置文件，配置文件的格式考：https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/settings.html 1234567[root@linuxprobe ~]# egrep -v &quot;^#|^$&quot; /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml [root@linuxprobe ~]# egrep -v &quot;^#|^$&quot; /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.ymlnode.name: node-1path.data: /var/lib/elasticsearchpath.logs: /var/log/elasticsearchnetwork.host: 10.1.1.53 # 默认localhost，自定义为iphttp.port: 9200 RPM还具有系统配置文件（/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch），允许您设置以下参数： 1234567[root@linuxprobe elasticsearch]# egrep -v &quot;^#|^$&quot; /etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch ES_HOME=/usr/share/elasticsearchJAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_111CONF_DIR=/etc/elasticsearchDATA_DIR=/var/lib/elasticsearchLOG_DIR=/var/log/elasticsearchPID_DIR=/var/run/elasticsearch 日志配置 Elasticsearch使用Log4j 2进行日志记录。 Log4j 2可以使用log4j2配置。属性文件。 Elasticsearch公开单个属性$ {sys：es。日志}，可以在配置文件中引用以确定日志文件的位置;这将在运行时解析为Elasticsearch日志文件的前缀。 例如，如果您的日志目录是/var/log/elasticsearch并且您的集群名为production，那么$ {sys：es。 logs}将解析为/var/log/elasticsearch/production。 默认日志配置存在：/etc/elasticsearch/log4j2.properties 安装 Kibana Kibana的RPM可以从ELK官网或从RPM存储库下载。它可用于在任何基于RPM的系统（如OpenSuSE，SLES，Centos，Red Hat和Oracle Enterprise）上安装Kibana。 导入Elastic PGP Key 我们使用弹性签名密钥（PGP密钥D88E42B4，可从https://pgp.mit.edu）签名所有的包，指纹： 1rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch 创建kibana源 123456789echo &apos;[kibana-5.x]name=Kibana repository for 5.x packagesbaseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/5.x/yumgpgcheck=1gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearchenabled=1autorefresh=1type=rpm-md&apos; | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/kibana.repo kibana源创建成功之后，makecache后使用yum安装kibana： 1yum makecache &amp;&amp; yum install kibana -y 使用systemd运行Kibana 要将Kibana配置为在系统引导时自动启动，请运行以下命令： 12sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reloadsudo /bin/systemctl enable kibana.service Kibana可以如下启动和停止12sudo systemctl start kibana.servicesudo systemctl stop kibana.service 配置Kibana Kibana默认从/etc/kibana/kibana.yml文件加载其配置。参考：https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/settings.html 注意：本实验教程把localhost都改成服务器IP，如果不更改localhost，需要设置反向代理才能访问到kibana。 在同一服务器上安装一个Nginx反向代理，以允许外部访问。 安装nginx 配置Kibana在localhost上监听，必须设置一个反向代理，允许外部访问它。本文使用Nginx来实现发向代理。 创建nginx官方源来安装nginx 12345678# https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/echo &apos;[nginx]name=nginx repobaseurl=http://nginx.org/packages/centos/$releasever/$basearch/gpgcheck=0enabled=1&apos; | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo 使用yum安装nginx和httpd-tools 1yum install nginx httpd-tools -y 使用htpasswd创建一个名为“kibanaadmin”的管理员用户（可以使用其他名称），该用户可以访问Kibana Web界面： 1234[root@linuxprobe ~]# htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/htpasswd.users kibanaadminNew password: # 自定义Re-type new password: Adding password for user kibanaadmin 使用vim配置nginx配置文件 1234567891011121314151617[root@linuxprobe ~]# egrep -v &quot;#|^$&quot; /etc/nginx/conf.d/kibana.conf server &#123; listen 80; server_name kibana.aniu.co; access_log /var/log/nginx/kibana.aniu.co.access.log main; error_log /var/log/nginx/kibana.aniu.co.access.log; auth_basic &quot;Restricted Access&quot;;

proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade; &#125;&#125; 保存并退出。这将配置Nginx将您的服务器的HTTP流量定向到在本地主机5601上侦听的Kibana应用程序。此外，Nginx将使用我们之前创建的htpasswd.users文件，并需要基本身份验证。 1234# 启动nginx并验证配置sudo systemctl start nginxsudo systemctl enable nginx SELinux已禁用。如果不是这样，您可能需要运行以下命令使Kibana正常工作：sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1 访问kibana，输入上面设置的kibanaadmin, password 上图可以看出kibana已经安装成功，需要配置一个 索引模式 安装Logstash 创建Logstash源 12345678910111213# 导入公共签名密钥rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch# 将以下内容添加到具有.repo后缀的文件中的/etc/yum.repos.d/目录中，如logstash.repoecho &apos;[logstash-5.x]name=Elastic repository for 5.x packagesbaseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/5.x/yumgpgcheck=1gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearchenabled=1autorefresh=1type=rpm-md&apos; | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/logstash.repo 使用yum安装logstash 1yum makecache &amp;&amp; yum install logstash -y 生成SSL证书 由于我们将使用Filebeat将日志从我们的客户端服务器发送到我们的ELK服务器，我们需要创建一个SSL证书和密钥对。 Filebeat使用该证书来验证ELK Server的身份。使用以下命令创建将存储证书和私钥的目录： 使用以下命令（在ELK服务器的FQDN中替换）在适当的位置（/etc/pki/tls/ …）中生成SSL证书和私钥： 1234567891011cd /etc/pki/tlssudo openssl req -subj &apos;/CN=ELK_server_fqdn/&apos; -x509 -days 3650 -batch -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private/logstash-forwarder.key -out certs/logstash-forwarder.crt# 注：ELK_server_fqdn自定义，示例如下：[root@linuxprobe ~]# cd /etc/pki/tls[root@linuxprobe tls]# sudo openssl req -subj &apos;/CN=kibana.aniu.co/&apos; -x509 -days 3650 -batch -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private/logstash-forwarder.key -out certs/logstash-forwarder.crtGenerating a 2048 bit RSA private key.+++...........................................................................................................+++writing new private key to &apos;private/logstash-forwarder.key&apos;----- logstash-forwarder.crt文件将被复制到，所有将日志发送到Logstash的服务器 配置Logstash Logstash配置文件为JSON格式，驻留在/etc/logstash/conf.d中。该配置由三个部分组成：输入，过滤和输出。 创建一个名为01-beats-input.conf的配置文件，并设置我们的“filebeat”输入： 1sudo vi /etc/logstash/conf.d/01-beats-input.conf 插入以下输入配置 12345678input &#123; beats &#123; port =&gt; 5044 ssl =&gt; true ssl_certificate =&gt; &quot;/etc/pki/tls/certs/logstash-forwarder.crt&quot; ssl_key =&gt; &quot;/etc/pki/tls/private/logstash-forwarder.key&quot; &#125;&#125; 保存退出，监听TCP 5044端口上beats 输入，使用上面创建的SSL证书加密 创建一个名为10-syslog-filter.conf的配置文件，我们将为syslog消息添加一个过滤器： 1sudo vim /etc/logstash/conf.d/10-syslog-filter.conf 插入以下输入配置 12345678910111213filter &#123; if [type] == &quot;syslog&quot; &#123; grok &#123; match =&gt; &#123; &quot;message&quot; =&gt; &quot;%&#123;SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:syslog_timestamp&#125; %&#123;SYSLOGHOST:syslog_hostname&#125; %&#123;DATA:syslog_program&#125;(?:\[%&#123;POSINT:syslog_pid&#125;\])?: %&#123;GREEDYDATA:syslog_message&#125;&quot; &#125; add_field =&gt; [ &quot;received_at&quot;, &quot;%&#123;@timestamp&#125;&quot; ] add_field =&gt; [ &quot;received_from&quot;, &quot;%&#123;host&#125;&quot; ] &#125; syslog_pri &#123; &#125; date &#123; match =&gt; [ &quot;syslog_timestamp&quot;, &quot;MMM d HH:mm:ss&quot;, &quot;MMM dd HH:mm:ss&quot; ] &#125; &#125;&#125; save和quit。此过滤器查找标记为“syslog”类型（由Filebeat）的日志，并且将尝试使用grok解析传入的syslog日志，以使其结构化和可查询。 创建一个名为logstash-simple的配置文件,示例文件： 1vim /etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash-simple.conf 插入以下输入配置 12345input &#123; stdin &#123; &#125; &#125;output &#123; elasticsearch &#123; hosts =&gt; [&quot;localhost:9200&quot;] &#125; stdout &#123; codec =&gt; rubydebug &#125;&#125; 这个输出基本上配置Logstash来存储input数据到Elasticsearch中，运行在localhost：9200 运行Logstash使用Systemd12sudo systemctl start logstash.servicesudo systemctl enable logstash.service 注： 到这里可能会出现Logstash重启失败，等问题，查看日志，锁定具体问题，一般不会出错 加载Kibana仪表板 Elastic提供了几个样例Kibana仪表板和Beats索引模式，可以帮助我们开始使用Kibana。虽然我们不会在本教程中使用仪表板，我们仍将加载它们，以便我们可以使用它包括的Filebeat索引模式。 首先，将示例仪表板归档下载到您的主目录： 12cd /usr/local/srccurl -L -O https://download.elastic.co/beats/dashboards/beats-dashboards-1.1.0.zip 安装unzip包，解压beats 123sudo yum -y install unzipunzip beats-dashboards-*.zip./load.sh 这些是我们刚加载的索引模式： [packetbeat-]YYYY.MM.DD [topbeat-]YYYY.MM.DD [filebeat-]YYYY.MM.DD [winlogbeat-]YYYY.MM.DD 我们开始使用Kibana时，我们将选择Filebeat索引模式作为默认值。 ##在Elasticsearch中加载Filebeat索引模板 因为我们计划使用Filebeat将日志发送到Elasticsearch，我们应该加载Filebeat索引模板。索引模板将配置Elasticsearch以智能方式分析传入的Filebeat字段。 首先，将Filebeat索引模板下载到您的主目录： 12cd /usr/local/srccurl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/thisismitch/3429023e8438cc25b86c/raw/d8c479e2a1adcea8b1fe86570e42abab0f10f364/filebeat-index-template.json 然后使用此命令加载模板： 123456# 注：执行命令的位置和json模板相同[root@linuxprobe src]# curl -XPUT &apos;http://localhost:9200/_template/filebeat?pretty&apos; -d@filebeat-index-template.json&#123; &quot;acknowledged&quot; : true&#125; 现在我们的ELK服务器已准备好接收Filebeat数据，移动到在每个客户端服务器上设置Filebeat。 设置Filebeat（添加客户端服务器） 对于要将日志发送到ELK服务器的每个CentOS或RHEL 7服务器，请执行以下步骤。 复制ssl证书 在ELK服务器上，将先决条件教程中创建的SSL证书复制到客户端服务器： 1234567# 使用SCP远程实现复制yum -y install openssh-clinets# scp /etc/pki/tls/certs/logstash-forwarder.crt root@linux-node1:/tmp# 注：如果不适用ip，记得在ELK服务器上设置hosts 在提供您的登录凭据后，请确保证书复制成功。它是客户端服务器和ELK服务器之间的通信所必需的,在客户端服务器上，将ELK服务器的SSL证书复制到适当的位置（/etc/pki/tls/certs）: 12[root@linux-node1 ~]# sudo mkdir -p /etc/pki/tls/certs[root@linux-node1 ~]# sudo cp /tmp/logstash-forwarder.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/ 安装Filebeat包 在客户端服务器上，创建运行以下命令将Elasticsearch公用GPG密钥导入rpm：参考上面： 1234567891011sudo rpm --import http://packages.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch#echo &apos;[elasticsearch-5.x]name=Elasticsearch repository for 5.x packagesbaseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/5.x/yumgpgcheck=1gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearchenabled=1autorefresh=1type=rpm-md&apos; | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/elasticsearch.repo 源创建完成之后使用yum安装filebeat 12yum makecache &amp;&amp; yum install filebeat -ysudo chkconfig --add filebeat 配置filebeat123456789101112[root@linux-node1 ~]# egrep -v &quot;#|^$&quot; /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml filebeat.prospectors:- input_type: log paths: - /var/log/secure # 新增 - /var/log/messages # 新增 - /var/log/*.logoutput.elasticsearch: hosts: [&quot;localhost:9200&quot;]output.logstash: hosts: [&quot;kibana.aniu.co:5044&quot;] # 修改为ELK上Logstash的连接方式 ssl.certificate_authorities: [&quot;/etc/pki/tls/certs/logstash-forwarder.crt&quot;] # 新增 Filebeat的配置文件是YAML格式的，注意缩进 启动filebeat 12sudo systemctl start filebeatsudo systemctl enable filebeat 注：客户端前提是已经配置完成elasticsearch服务，并且设置好域名解析filebeat启动完成后，可以观察ELK上面的journalctl -f和logstash，以及客户端的filebeat日志，查看filebeat是否生效 连接Kibana 参考官方文档设置：https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/5.x/index.html 到此我们完成了ELK基础环境的搭建，后面教程具体实现每个服务的具体功能，以及相关插件的使用。]]></content>

Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud. Source: What is Docker Where to start?

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[win10+hexo+github搭建个人博客 参考：https://hexo.io/，博客用于记录自己的学习工作历程 参考以下步骤安装 1、搭建环境准备（包括node.js和git环境，gitHub账户的配置）2、安装 配置Hexo,配置将Hexo与github page结合起来3、怎样发布文章 主题 推荐 主题4、Net的简单配置 添加sitemap和feed插件5、添加404 公益页面 安装并配置环境 win10+Node.js+git+github Node.js下载地址：https://nodejs.org/en/download/ Git下载地址：https://git-scm.com/ Github 地址：https://github.com 安装node.js 和 git 步骤省略，按默认傻瓜式安装即可 注册github账号并创建一个以 github昵称.github.io 命名的仓库 根据图中，注册一个github账号，昵称自定义，然后创建一个新项目，名字为：github昵称.github.io 项目创建完成之后，本地生成ssh 私钥和公钥，用于连接github认证，使用上面下载的git，打开git bash 12ssh-keygen -t rsa -C &quot;github注册邮箱（自定义）&quot; -f .ssh/shaonbean# -f 输出以昵称命名的公钥和私钥，方便记忆 公钥生成之后加到github上，方便后面的使用，用户本地和github进行ssh通信 到这里github设置告一段落 安装配置hexo 注：hexo安装前提需安装node.js 和git hexo官网：https://hexo.io/ hexo官方文档：https://hexo.io/docs/ 文中以J盘为例，创建目录github并创建字目录（用于存放项目） 12vdevops@shaon MINGW64 /j/github/shaonbean# 注： 如果是linux环境下搭建的hexo博客，不建议使用root权限 下载安装hexo 123npm install -g hexo-cli# 等待片刻，执行hexo如下图表示安装成功hexo 初始化博客 这里以shaonbean为博客目录，执行下面命令 123hexo init shaonbean # 创始化项目cd shaonbeannpm install 测试本地建站是否成功，输入： 1234hexo sINFO Start processingINFO Hexo is running at http://localhost:4000/. Press Ctrl+C to stop.# 出现上面两行，即表示本地建站成功 初始化博客以后，能看到下图： 配置博客 博客根目录初始化完成之后进项自定义配置，这里用到_config.yml 自定义博客的相关信息 编辑_config.yml配置文件，进行修改，参考下面配置： 1234567title: itdevopssubtitle: DevOps is everythingdescription: From Zero to the DevOpsauthor: shaonbeanlanguage: zh-CNtimezone: Asia/Shanghai# language和timezone 有规范，注意格式 配置个人域名1url: http://vdevops.com 配置部署1234deploy: type: git repo: https://github.com/shaonbean/shaonbean.github.io.git branch: master repo项是之前Github上创建好的仓库的地址 123exec ssh-agent bashssh-add MYKEY# 这里是针对本地设置多个github账号进行操作 本地生成两对密钥对，然后在~/.ssh/目录下新建config文件，参考下面填入： 12345678910111213#————GitHub—————Host github HostName github.com User git PreferredAuthentications publickey IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa# github.ioHost github.io HostName github.com User git PreferredAuthentications publickey IdentityFile ~/.ssh/itdevops 测试本地ssh连接github是否正常 123ssh -T git@githubssh -T git@github.io# 笔者这里第二个账号没设置成功，临时使用的https方式进行的通信 使用https，github账号加密码的方式来进行hexo的部署。配置如下： 123456deploy: type: git #repo: git@github.io:shaonbean/shaonbean.github.io.git repo: https://shaonbean:shaonbeanpassword@github.com/shaonbean/shaonbean.github.io.git branch: master message: devops 配置完成之后，现在可以进到设置的项目目录里面通过hexo部署到github 进到你的项目目录。命令行执行下面命令： 12hexo g # 本地生成数据库文件，目录等hexo d # 部署到远程 新建一篇博客 1hexo new post &quot;devops&quot; 然后通过电脑编辑器（atom）对文章进行编辑，编辑完成之后，再次运行上面的生成，部署命令 123hexo g # 本地生成博客hexo d # 发布到远程hexo d -g #在部署前先生成 注： 安装git扩展 12npm install hexo-deployer-git --save# 没安装插件可能报错：deloyer not found:git ssh key报错 1234Permission denied (publickey).fatal: Could not read from remote repository.Please make sure you have the correct access rightsand the repository exists. 后面笔者会专门写一篇添加ssh 密钥的文章 部署完成可以看到github上面shaonbean.github.io，已经存在文件，通过浏览器访问如下： 从上面可以看出我们已经成功部署到远程，并能够正常访问。 配置博客主题 选择NexT，star最多，原因不多说知乎主题推荐：https://www.zhihu.com/question/24422335 12cd /j/github/shaonbean.github.io # 这里项目名可以自定义git clone https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next themes/next 更换主题完成后，访问： 参考链接 http://blog.csdn.net/gdutxiaoxu/article/details/53576018 http://www.jeyzhang.com/hexo-github-blog-building.html https://www.zrj96.com/post-471.html https://fuyis.me/2017/01/25/Hexo-theme-next-and-optimized-configuration/]]></content>
